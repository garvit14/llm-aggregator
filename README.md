# LLM Comparator

This is a very simple personal user LLM comparator that helps in passing same prompts to multiple LLMs and then viewing their output in UI and then take a call which one is better.

Supported LLMs:
1. ChatGPT
2. Gemini
3. Claude
4. Llama

## How to run
### Backend
- Get key for ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude and set them in the environment
- Run llama locally (ollama can be used to run llama locally)
- `npm install`
- `npm run execute`

### Frontend
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
